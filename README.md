# My Journey in Programming Logic

This repository documents my progress and practical application of **core programming fundamentals** across different languages. It serves as a portfolio to showcase my initial work and continuous learning in software development.

The projects are currently organized by language, allowing for a clear overview of my skills in **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **C++**.

## What You Will Find Here

This collection consists of small projects and exercises designed to build a solid foundation in key programming concepts:

* **Logic and Control Flow:** Practical scripts demonstrating control over program execution using **conditional statements** (`if/else`, `elif`) and efficient **looping structures** (`for` loops).
* **Data Handling:** Examples of managing basic data types (integers, floats, strings) and using fundamental **data structures** (arrays/lists) for tasks like **calculating averages** and input processing.
* **Basic Algorithms:** Implementations of simple, common algorithms for tasks such as **parity checks** (odd/even), **arithmetic calculations**, and **unit conversions**.
* **Object-Oriented Basics:** Initial explorations into **Class definition**, **Constructors**, and **Static members** to understand object encapsulation and reusable code structures.

## Future Focus

I am committed to continually expanding this repository. My immediate focus for future additions will be on:

* **Python:** Deeper exploration of data structures, functions, and more complex problem-solving algorithms.
* **JavaScript:** Enhancing interactive web elements and DOM manipulation, moving towards more dynamic scripting.
